This study presents an experimental methodological approach to evaluate operational uniforms used by 
the Military Fire Department of Santa Catarina (CBMSC). Three uniforms applicable to Terrestrial 
Search operations were compared: the 5ºA standard uniform, the MultiMission PPE, and the proposed 
Lightweight MultiMission PPE. The methodology integrated three main pillars: functional mobility 
assessment (using the Functional Movement Screen – FMS protocol), thermal analysis (using sensors 
specially developed for this study and validated by laboratory tests), and users’ subjective perception 
(through structured questionnaires). The results indicated significant differences among the uniforms, 
particularly regarding mobility and thermal comfort. The 5ºA uniform showed the best overall performance, 
although the Lightweight MultiMission PPE demonstrated specific advantages in mobility and comfort. 
The methodology proposed in this study may serve as a basis for evidence-based decisions regarding the 
use and development of operational uniforms, reinforcing the importance of integrated and replicable 
approaches for future evaluations within CBMSC.
